### What is module

It's one or many functions that can be exported and imported from files to others in a project. A module is a single JavaScript file.


### What is package ?

A package is a module or collection of modules. A package is a directory with one or more modules inside of it and a package.json file which has metadata about the package.


### What is the difference between a module and a package?

When a module is used, it uses functions from one specific file, when a package is used, it uses the module(s) grouped in that package.

E.g:

Shapes             <- Package name
  - Circle.js      <-
  - Rectangle.js   <- Modules that belong to the Shapes package
  - Square.js      <-


### What is NPM ?

NPM is the node package manager, we can install many packages by using the command ```npm install ... ```

### What is Webpack ?

"Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles."


### How do you create a new React project ?

By using ```create-react-app <name_of_project>```

### What are these files and folders in a project:

- package.json => here we will find the dependecies of the applications (packages installed), it also manage the scripts, versions, etc.
- package-lock.json or yarn.lock => this file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
- .gitignore => this file cames when the react app is created, it contains all the files or folders that are not supposed to be uploaded in the github repository.
- node_modules => store all the necessary node packages of the react applications.
- public => initially, this name was given to the directory that contained files that should be public as index.html, by creating an app with React it not only creates an ```index.html``` but also generates these files: ```favicon.io, manifest.json , robots.txt```


### What is your favorite code editor (I believe that it is Visual Studio Code) ?

Yes, it is ::party::

#### Add different Visual Studio Code extensions to improve your productivity(eg. prettier, ESLint etc) âœ…

####  Try to make different module in a different file and import it to index.js. âœ…

I created a react app while practicing the exercises of day 03 and i moved ```myInfo``` to a different file from ```index.js```, exported it and imported it in ```index.js``` ðŸ˜¬
